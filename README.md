# Swamp Club — a theme for [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)

The [swamp-club.com](https://swamp-club.com) palette in your terminal: a
black canvas, neutral gray text, the site's green accent, a `#39ff14` neon
cursor and bright-green, and the cyan and magenta of the logo's glitch.

It pairs with a sidebar theme for the [herdr](https://herdr.dev) workspace
manager so the panes and the chrome around them share one palette:
[herdr-swamp-club](https://github.com/sntxrr/herdr-swamp-club).

## Install

### One line

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sntxrr/ghostty-swamp-club/main/install.sh | bash
```

That writes the theme to `~/.config/ghostty/themes/swamp-club`, backs up
your Ghostty config next to itself, and sets `theme = swamp-club` (replacing
an existing `theme =` line if you had one). Then reload Ghostty:
**`⌘⇧,`** on macOS, **`Ctrl+Shift+,`** elsewhere.

Add `--dry-run` to see what it would touch, or `--theme-only` to install the
file and leave your config alone.

### By hand

1. Save [`themes/swamp-club`](themes/swamp-club) to `~/.config/ghostty/themes/swamp-club`:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/ghostty/themes
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sntxrr/ghostty-swamp-club/main/themes/swamp-club \
        -o ~/.config/ghostty/themes/swamp-club
   ```

   This is the only directory Ghostty searches for user themes — on macOS
   too, even if your config lives in `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/`.

2. Add one line to your Ghostty config:

   ```
   theme = swamp-club
   ```

3. Reload: `⌘⇧,` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+,` elsewhere.

### Light and dark

Ghostty can pick a theme per system appearance. Swamp Club is dark-only, so
pair it with something light:

```
theme = light:Catppuccin Latte,dark:swamp-club
```

## Uninstall

Remove the `theme = swamp-club` line (or restore the backup the installer
wrote), delete `~/.config/ghostty/themes/swamp-club`, and reload.

## Palette

![Swamp Club palette](screenshots/palette.svg)

| slot | normal | bright |
|---|---|---|
| black | `#1a1a1a` | `#6b7280` |
| red | `#ff003c` | `#f87171` |
| green | `#05df72` | **`#39ff14`** |
| yellow | `#fde047` | `#fef08a` |
| blue | `#60a5fa` | `#93c5fd` |
| magenta | `#e879f9` | `#f0abfc` |
| cyan | `#00d3f2` | `#67e8f9` |
| white | `#d1d5db` | `#ffffff` |

| | |
|---|---|
| background | `#080808` |
| foreground | `#d1d5db` |
| cursor | `#39ff14` on `#080808` |
| selection | `#d1d5db` on `#062e16` |
| split divider | `#06411e` |

Every color is taken from swamp-club.com as it renders, not guessed from a
screenshot:

- **Canvas and text** are the site's: `#080808` panels, `#d1d5db` body text,
  `#fff` headings. No green tint -- the site keeps its neutrals neutral and
  lets the neon do the work.
- **Green** (`#05df72`) is the site's accent text color (Tailwind v4
  green-400), the most-used color on the page after the grays.
- **Bright green** (`#39ff14`) is the site's glow, scanline and input-caret
  neon. It's in the bright slot on purpose: it's what `ls`, git and most
  prompts reach for to mark success, so the glow shows up in everyday output
  while the normal green stays readable in bulk. The cursor is the same neon,
  as it is in the site's input fields.
- **Cyan** (`#00d3f2`) is the logo and the event counter; **magenta**
  (`#e879f9`) is the site's default profile accent; **red** (`#ff003c`) is its
  neon glitch.
- **Selection and divider** are the site's green-500 borders at 20% and 30%,
  flattened onto the background.

The site sets its text in [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
(`font-family = JetBrains Mono` in your Ghostty config) if you want the full
look.

## Tweaks

A theme file is just a Ghostty config file, and anything you set in your own
config wins over the theme. The knob people ask about first:

- **Comments too dim / too loud?** Bright black (`palette = 8=…`) is what most
  tools use for dim text. Override it in your config:

  ```
  palette = 8=#9ca3af
  ```

  `#9ca3af` is the site's own muted-text gray.

## Notes

- Tested on Ghostty 1.3. Any 1.x release with the `theme` option should work.
- The palette is borrowed, with affection, from [swamp-club.com](https://swamp-club.com).
